# Notebook Template

This directory is a template for fornax-demo-notebooks tutorials.
Tutorials are organized into directories by use case, with one or more notebooks per use case.

**For new use cases,** make a new directory with a name that describes the use case.

**For new notebooks,** make a copy of the `notebook_template.md` and requirements_notebook_template.txt files and put them in an existing use-case directory.
Change "notebook_template" in both file names to a notebook name of your choosing.
The file has further instructions for its use.

Note that all contributed notebools should be in [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org) format.
