# Notebook Template

This directory is a template for fornax-demo-notebooks tutorials.
Tutorials are organized into directories by use case, with one or more notebooks per use case.
The template loosely follows the Space Telescope Science Institute
[Style Guides](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/).

**For new use cases,** make a new directory with a name that describes the use case.

**For new notebooks,** make a copy of the `notebook_template.md` file and put it in a
use-case directory. Change "notebook_template" in the file name to a notebook name of
your choosing. The file has further instructions for its use.
